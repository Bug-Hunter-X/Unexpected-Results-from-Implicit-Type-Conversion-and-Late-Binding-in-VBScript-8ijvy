Late Binding and Implicit Type Conversion Issues: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to track down during development.  Implicit type conversion, while convenient, can cause unexpected results if not carefully managed. For example, comparing a string to a number might yield unintended Boolean results. Consider the following example:
```vbscript
Dim strValue, numValue
strValue = "10"
numValue = 10
if strValue = numValue then
  MsgBox "Equal"
else
  MsgBox "Not Equal"
end if
```
This comparison might not behave as expected because of VBScript's implicit type conversion, leading to unexpected results. Additionally, late binding can make it harder to catch type-related errors early on.
