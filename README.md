# VBScript Implicit Type Conversion and Late Binding Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to implicit type conversion and late binding.  VBScript's flexibility in type handling can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

## The Bug
The `bug.vbs` file contains VBScript code that compares a string to a number.  Due to implicit type conversion, the comparison result may not be what's intuitively expected.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version of the code, explicitly handling type conversion to ensure the comparison yields the intended result.  This emphasizes the importance of explicit type checking in VBScript to avoid subtle errors.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.vbs` and run it using a VBScript interpreter.
3. Observe the unexpected output.
4. Compare the output to the expected output documented in the solution file.
5. Run `bugSolution.vbs` to see the corrected behavior. 

This example highlights the need for careful type handling and defensive programming when working with VBScript.
