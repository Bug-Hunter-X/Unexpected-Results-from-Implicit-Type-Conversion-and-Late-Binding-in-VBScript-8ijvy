Explicit Type Checking and Early Binding:
To avoid unexpected behavior, use explicit type checking and consider early binding where possible.  Explicitly convert data types before comparisons to ensure accurate results. For example:
```vbscript
Dim strValue, numValue
strValue = "10"
numValue = 10
if CInt(strValue) = numValue then
  MsgBox "Equal"
else
  MsgBox "Not Equal"
end if
```
This version uses `CInt` to convert `strValue` to an integer before the comparison, eliminating the ambiguity caused by implicit type conversion. Early binding, while requiring more upfront work, can help catch type-related errors during compilation rather than at runtime.
